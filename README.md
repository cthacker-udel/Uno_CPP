# This is the UNO cpp project


## We have three classes
- Card
  - Controls what the card is
- Deck
  - Controls the lists of Cards
- Uno
  - Controls the behavior of the Decks


Each player is represented as a Deck, and that deck has a list of cards, the Uno is mainly
used as a runner class and combines Deck and Card to create a playable Uno game
